Here are the projects I may be working on (or maybe not).

[Seir](https://github.com/blagodarin/seir) is a framework for building interactive software.
It provides a set of C++ libraries and tools along with a CMake-based package management solution,
enabling to easily create compact and functional cross-platform applications.

Seir is used in:
* [Blocks](https://github.com/blagodarin/blocks) â€” a simple Tetris-like game with music and graphics
  built as a single 1.5 MiB binary without any extra dependencies.
